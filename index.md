# Welcome to my Knowledge Base 🧠

Hi, I'm **Ellesse** — a SaaS-savvy, self-proclaimed _technical griot_.

This digital help center showcases my ability to design, write, and manage documentation systems — both internal and external —  making complex technical ideas digestible for all. It’s part portfolio, part personal wiki — all written, designed, and structured by me.

Whether you're a recruiter, hiring manager, or just curious, feel free to explore.

### 🌱 Why This?

I’m making a bold career shift — but I bring *both* transferable soft skills *and* direct technical experience (from freelance work and SaaS implementation projects). I wanted a portfolio that reflects:

- My **love for learning and documentation**
- My **ability to distill complexity**
- My **deep respect for user education, support, and success**

### 🛠️ What’s Under the Hood?

This site is built using:
- **Markdown**, GitHub, and the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme
- Organized like an internal wiki or help center
- Updated in real time as I evolve and add more examples
