# Welcome to my Knowledge Base 🧠

Hi, I'm **Ellesse** — a SaaS-savvy, self-proclaimed _technical griot_.

This digital help center showcases how I approach knowledge creation, storytelling through systems, and making complex technical ideas digestible for real people. It’s part portfolio, part personal wiki — all written, designed, and structured by me.

Whether you're a recruiter, hiring manager, or just curious, feel free to explore.

### 🧭 Quick Navigation

- [Systems Audit](systems-audit.md): An in-depth, unofficial audit of a company or product I admire — featuring user journey analysis, UX insights, and retention recommendations.
- [Tutorial Guide](tutorial-guide.md): A step-by-step documentation of how to use or implement a SaaS tool or workflow. Written in my signature style: clear, helpful, and a little bit spicy.
- [Case Study: Tech Storytelling](case-study.md): A narrative-style case study showing how I translated stakeholder chaos into clarity, using documentation, diagrams, and empathy.

### 🌱 Why This?

I’m making a bold career shift — but I bring *both* transferable soft skills *and* direct technical experience (from freelance work and SaaS implementation projects). I wanted a portfolio that reflects:

- My **love for learning and documentation**
- My **ability to distill complexity**
- My **deep respect for user education, support, and success**

### 🛠️ What’s Under the Hood?

This site is built using:
- **Markdown**, GitHub, and the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme
- Organized like an internal wiki or help center
- Updated in real time as I evolve and add more examples
